# Dotfiles - secondsquadron

These are my current dotfiles. I use them on **Debian** _testing_.
There are (and will be) other files as well, some system configuration file,
manually made desktop files, etc. which are enough important to backup and share.

## Vim
I use **vim-plug** to maintain vim plugins. Pretty convenient!\

## Bash
As a bash user I find **bash-it** the best way to get nice themes,
git integration and other functionality.
Basically I just use plain powerline theme and forgit.\

## Gdb
Once there was a nice debugger called SoftICE which I really liked. This
init file tries to bring back it's interface. Also, set the disassembly
style to Intel. \

##  Conky
I am a big fan of **conky**. I use a customized theme from **Aureola**.
Added nvidia related nodes.\

## Clang-format
Clang is a great tool to stlyle code. Currently I just use the Qt stlyle for my
code.
